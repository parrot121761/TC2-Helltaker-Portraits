```loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parrot121761/TC2-Helltaker-Portraits/refs/heads/main/helltakerportraits.lua'))()```

* The script will take a while to download all of the assets on first execution. You can see the progress of the download in the console. 
* If the script keeps failing to download the assets, download the "portraits" folder here manually, put it in your workspace folder and rename it to "Helltaker"
